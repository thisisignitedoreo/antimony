# antimony
script to track and statisticly organize game playtime
_continuation of [one of my gists](https://gist.github.com/thisisignitedoreo/3212cd92016ba03fca86412bb134734e)_

## quickstart

```console
$ ./main.py help
```

## how to generate images?
create a folder under assets/imgs with your game slug, and add a `banner.png`
and `icon.png` to there. i added a few examples. then run `$ ./main.py img <slug>`,
it will generate `<slug>.png` in cwd.

why antimony? idk, its just my favourite chemical element.
